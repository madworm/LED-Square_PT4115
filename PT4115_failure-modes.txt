PT4115 failure modes:
=====================

* Busted DIM pin. This one REALLY needs over-voltage protection!
  (5.1V Zener diode + dropper resistor)

  Observed manifestations:

  - LOW resistance from DIM to GND (6 Ohm, or 30-ish Ohm)
  - LEDs are permanently on + massive overcurrent
  - LEDs are permanently off
